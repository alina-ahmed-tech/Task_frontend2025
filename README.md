# Un.titled Front End Developer test project

## Objectives

- Recreate the following design as closely as possible:
  - [page design](assets/img/design.png)
  - [popup modal design](assets/img/design-modal.png)
- Clone this repo, and when you've finished zip it up and email to the email address provided by HR (please leave all working files, but remove node_modules if you have it!)

## Spec

- The header should be sticky.
- The header, banner image & footer should be full bleed.
- Other content should have a max column width of 1500px.
- Links don't need to go anywhere. You can provide example markup.
- The map overlay should be triggered when clicking on the `View map` button.

## Assets

- Images/icons are stored in the `assets` folder.
- Fonts can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins).
- Map embed code:
